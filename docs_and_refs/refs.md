# random forest explanation:

- 1: set up the data source
- 2: clean the data (dropna())
- 3: create the model 
- 4: split the data into training and test data
- 5: once the data is split up, train the model on the Open, 'High', 'Low' and 'Volume'
- 6: the set the target to be close
- 7: once the model is trained, check the model score on a scale of 0-1, the higher the better. 
- 8: make a new prediction based on the trained model for the test data
